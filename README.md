The datasets are extracted from multiple sources and are extremely large; therefore, they are not uploaded to GitHub due to file size limitations.

# PROJECT 1 - INSTACART DATA ANALYTICS
## Detailed Analysis
For in-depth analysis and findings, please refer to [Instacart_Data_Analysis.pdf](./Instacart_Data_Analysis.pdf)


Project Overview
This project analyzes grocery shopping patterns using a comprehensive Instacart dataset containing over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 users. The analysis leverages Tableau to create interactive visualizations and uncover insights about customer behavior, product preferences, and operational patterns.

Key Analysis Areas
Service Analysis

Identified the busiest days of the week and peak shopping hours

Analyzed customer reorder frequency and timing patterns

Examined the relationship between order timing and customer behavior

Product Analysis

Determined top-selling products and bestsellers

Analyzed first-time purchase patterns and customer preferences

Calculated reorder probabilities for different products

Studied typical order sizes and item quantities per transaction

Category Analysis

Created treemap visualizations of the most popular aisles and product categories

Analyzed department-level sales frequency and performance

Grouped time periods to identify distinct shopping patterns (weekend rush, evening hours, early birds, etc.)

Methodology
The project employed Tableau's relationship modeling to connect six different data tables (orders, products, aisles, departments, and order-product mappings). Advanced Tableau features were used including calculated fields, filters, groupings, and various chart types to create a comprehensive data story.

Business Value
This analysis provides actionable insights for inventory management, staffing optimization, marketing campaigns, and customer experience improvements by understanding when customers shop, what they buy, and how their purchasing behaviors evolve over time.
